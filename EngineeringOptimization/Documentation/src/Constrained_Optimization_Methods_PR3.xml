	<title>Constrained Optimization Methods â€” Project 3</title>
	<para>As Dr. Mohamed El-Sayed shows in <xref
			linkend="pr_3_screenshot_assignment"/>, the assignment is to develop
		and use a constrained optimization program to solve two arbitrary
		constrained optimization problems. We are also to provide a flow chart
		for the program, as well as its iteration history on the two problems.</para>

			<title>Calling the Constrained ALM Search</title>
			<para>The ALM minimization method is called as follows from within
				Mathematica: <command>NMinimize[{f,constr}, {{x[1], xMinInit[1],
					xMaxInit[1]},{x[1], xMinInit[1], xMaxInit[1]}, ..., {x[n],
					xMinInit[n], xMaxInit[n]}}, Method ->
					"AugmentedLagrangeMultiplier"]</command><footnote>
					<para>As with my line search and unconstrained
						multidimensional minimization commands, this one uses a
						syntax similar to an existing command within Mathematica
						and requires a method statement. In this case, the
						command is NMinimize and my method is
						"AugmentedLagrangeMultiplier".</para>
				</footnote>
				<footnote>
					<para>NMinimize and NMaximize are the only numerical
						optimization commands in the current version of
						Mathematica (5.2) that accept constraints. However, they
						are global optimization routines instead of
						derivative/local routines. Accordingly, they only take
						an interval for the initial "values" of the independent
						variables instead of taking a point. My routine accepts
						the same syntax, but the initial interval of a variable
						is first converted to its midpoint.</para>

						<para>The x[i], where i takes a value from 1 to n just

						<para>Method is an option that can be changed with a
