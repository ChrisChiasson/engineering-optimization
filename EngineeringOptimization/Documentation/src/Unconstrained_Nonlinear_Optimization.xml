	<title>Unconstrained Nonlinear Optimization  &#x2014; Homework 2</title>
	<para>As Dr. Mohamed El-Sayed shows in
		<xref linkend="hw_2_screenshot_assignment"/>, the assignment is to solve
		<olink targetdoc="self" targetptr="GNVNOTED"/> problems 3-2 through 3-7.
		The block quotation below gives the problem statements in their
		entirety. By the way, I realize screenshot says <quote>Ex:,</quote> but
		since there are no more examples in chapter 3 after example 3-3 and Dr.
		El-Sayed verbally mentioned problems rather than examples, I am doing
		the problems.</para>

	<para>The solution to all of the quoted questions is presented in
		<xref linkend="fig.hw2.minimizationpathsonfunctiondensityplot"/>
		and
		<xref linkend="table.hw2.ungraphedcriticalminimizationparameters"/>.
		The	calculations are available in APPENDIX . I suppose I could leave it at that, since the
		solution and its meaning is complete and self-evident to someone
		knowledgeable in optimization, but I think some comments
		are appropriate.</para>
	<para>A first thing to note about the graph is that I have
		iterated each method to converge on the minimum, not just through
		the requisite three steps. Doing so involved actually programming
		each method, instead of completing the problems <quote>by
			hand</quote>. In lecture, Dr. El-Sayed argued that programming
		each method is more a test of programming skill or in my case,
		doggedness, than engineering acumen. I agree, but I used the plot
		and table as a way to "debug" my work, so programming the methods
		was mainly to help me rather than show off.</para>
