	version="5">The picture contains a flow chart with light
	blue objects. The objects are rounded
	rectangles, regular rectangles, and rhombuses.
	The shapes stand for terminators, processes, and
	decisions. Dark blue lines connect all objects,
	with arrows	in the direction to be followed.
	All objects are pointed at by at one or more
	other objects. Terminators and processes only
	point to one other object. Decisions point to
	two objects; the flow direction depends on the
	outcome of the decision. By starting at the
	Given terminator and following the processes and
	decisions, one may see how the algorithm
	described by the flow chart works.</phrase>
